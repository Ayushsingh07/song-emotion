A Natural Language model to classify English songs based on emotions, using song lyrics as attribute.

The dataset used for this task is novel and was collected through web-scraping, employing Beautiful Soup packages for HTML parsing, to extract data of artists and songs from different genres. Label for each song was assigned manually from its lyrics. This project is unique due to its classification of songs based on emotions, giving users a unique playlist experience. WordNet-Affect package was employed to indicate word emotion by applying Bag of Words feature. Machine learning algorithms and Deep learning frameworks were implemented to build the classifier and performances of different models were compared to design the best Mood-based song classifier.
